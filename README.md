# BreakTheBrick
```
In break the brick game, the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and uses it to bounce a ball back up towards a wall of bricks at the top of the screen. The goal is to break all of the bricks by hitting them with the ball.

To implement this game, I used the programming language Java to create the graphics and handle the game logic which involved creating classes for the paddle, ball, and bricks, as well as handling user input, collision detection, and score tracking. Also everytime someone restarts, the game will loop and update the positions of the objects on the screen.

This is what I learned from this project
```
Object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Fundamental programming concepts, such as data types, variables, loops, and conditional statements.

Graphical user interface (GUI) development using Swing or JavaFX.

Event handling and user input, such as handling keyboard and mouse events.

Game development concepts, such as game loops, collision detection, and score tracking.

Working with 2D graphics and rendering shapes, text, and images on the screen.

Debugging and testing your game to ensure it is functioning correctly.
